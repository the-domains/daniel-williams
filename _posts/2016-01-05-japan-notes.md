Horror

Morning packing and preparation went sort of according to plan, with mild stress levels

On the train to ECR we checked flight status and saw that the Istanbul flight was delayed by 2.5hrs

Stress levels rising somewhat, but understanding there was nothing we could do

In queue for check in, realised we'd forgotten our rail pass exchange tickets

Delay could work in our favoured I could dash home to collect them

Stress levels exploding

Waiting in queue interminable

Got boarding pass and ran to train station

Train delayed so missed connection at ECR

Black cab to home, grabbed the tickets

Cab to Forest Hill, made it with 0 mins to spare

Train delayed by 2 mins, and a 2min change at Norwood junction

Heart attack imminent

Made it to Gatwick, sprinted to security, through quickly, sprinted to gate 19

Relief overwhelming

Next day

Lots of queuing, lots of waiting

Driven in a minibus to a Ramada Hotel in Fatih

One of the last names to get called to the bus, but then first to get called for a room at the hotel

Felt like the first lucky break in a long time

Nice hot shower in the hotel and about 4hrs sleep before getting up to catch the end on breakfast

Nice tahini

Watched NHK World on TV in our room, amazing cover of Superstition on traditional Japanese instruments. Guy rocking the shamikasen like a superstar

Feature on a capsule hotel in Shinjuku

Minibus back to airport through horrible traffic, maybe to do with some sort of demonstration near the airport

Bought headphones for the flight and 6litres of water

Funny guy tried to sell us a water dispenser bottle

Long flight no sleep

Watched The Gambler and Premium Rush

Listened to All Involved

-----

Arrival at Narita

Disembarkation cards filled and filled again

Luggage arrived, against expectations, and quite quickly

More cards to fill for customs

We made a swift exchange of our Japan Rail Pass orders and got booked on the next Shinjuku bound Narita Express

Tiredness and adrenaline buzzes alternating

Found the east exit of the station but failed to find the 3-chome station and wandered around wide-eyed for a short while

Back into the station we got pointed in the right direction and began the long walk to C3 exit

Very sweet old man at Tokyu Stay front desk gave us our pocket wifi router and organised for our luggage to be sent on to Eco and Tec

Told us he'd seen snow on top of Mt Fuji that morning from his window

Back to Shinjuku to take the Chuo line to Tokyo station

Found T's TanTan vegan ramen in the station, had two delicious steaming bowls. Oishii desu.

Woke up early and walked into Takayama, taking lots of photos in the mist along the way

Visited the morning markets and shops

Ate roasted rice balls and chestnut sweets

Up a big hill to a beautiful park forest, warning to beware of bears
